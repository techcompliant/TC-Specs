DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: FF32-EM Radar
    Version: 0x6673
    ID: 0x3846bc64
    Manufacturer: 0xb8badde8 (Otec)

Description:
    FF32-EM Radar is a far field electromagnetic pulse generator-detector. FF32-EM 
    system can detect the presence, distance and signature of spacecraft, ships, and 
    other objects, by sending out pulses of high-frequency electromagnetic waves 
    that are reflected off the object back to the source.

    Otec's FF32-EM can operate at 32km range and is capable of spherical radar 
    sweep in only 7200ms. FF32-EM holds internal target listed that is refreshed
    during radar sweep and can be queried with Otec's advanced interrupt API specified
    below.

Interrupt behavior:

    When a HWI is received by the Radar, it reads the A register and 
    does one of the following actions:
    
    0: GET_STATUS
        Register B is set to hold the number of targets left in FF32-EM internal 
        memory. This target list is repopulated every time that radar sweep completes
        and target is removed from the list when POP_TARGET returns it.

        Register C is set FF32-EM general status
          0x0000 Idle
          0x0001 Sweep in progress
          0xffff Equipment malfunction

    1: START_RADAR_SWEEP
        Starts the radar sweep. Sweep will take exactly 7200ms to complete. At sweep startup
        the internal target list is cleared and new list is build during the sweep.

        Register C is set to return status code for START_RADAR_SWEEP operation.
          0x0000 Sweep initiated succesfully
          0x8000 Sweep already in progress
          0xffff Equipment malfunction

    2: POP_TARGET
        Pop target provides information about a target detected during previous radar sweep.
        Targets are returned in the distance order - closest first.

        GET_STATUS returns (in register B) how many times POP_TARGET can be called before all
        detected targets are processed.

        Information
          A: Target signature
             16 bit signature that is typically unique to a target, but uniqueness is not quaranteed 
          B: Target data vector 00000000 00wwwwtt
             bits tt: Target type
                 00: Radar echo is untypical
                 10: Radar echo is typical for manmade object
                 01: Radar echo is typical for natural object
                 11: NA
             bit wwww: Target mass
                 0000:         0  kg - 10e2  kg
                 0001:      10e2  kg - 10e3  kg
                 0010:      10e3  kg - 10e4  kg
                 0011:      10e4  kg - 10e5  kg

                 0101:      10e6  kg - 10e7  kg
                 0110:      10e7  kg - 10e8  kg
                 0111:      10e8  kg - 10e9  kg
                 1000:      10e9  kg - 10e10 kg
                 1001:      10e10 kg - 10e11 kg
                 1010:      10e11 kg - 10e15 kg
                 1011:      10e15 kg - 10e20 kg
                 1100:      10e20 kg - 10e25 kg
                 1101:      10e25 kg - 10e35 kg
                 1110:      10e35 kg - 10e40 kg
                 1111:      10e40 kg - 

          X: Target X-coordinate relative to radar (m)
          Y: target Y-coordinate relative to radar (m)
          Z: target Z-coordinate relative to radar (m)

          Register C is set to status code for POP_TARGET operation.
            0x0000 Success
            0x0001 No target available
            0x8000 Sweep in progress
            0xffff Equipment malfunction

          Halts DCPU for 6 cycles.

    3: CONFIGURE_INTERRUPTS
        Register B contains message for Interrupt on sweep completed, 0 means disable interrupt.
