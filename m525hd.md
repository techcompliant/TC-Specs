|    Vendor code | 0x2eb37e91 | Mackapar Media
|      Device ID | 0x525d4ac5 | 5.25" Hard Disk Drive 
|    Device type | 0x4ac5     | 16 bit fixed Disk Drive
|        Version | 0x0001     | Dictates Size (5MB, 10MB)

Device Description

Mackapar Medias first foray into fixed storage resulted in the Mackapar Media m525hd.  
When formatted in 16 bit mode the m525hd has a capacity of 5MB. Data is saved on 4 
surfaces each containing 64 20-sector tracks. Each sector contains a total of 
512 words, resulting in a total of 5120 sectors.
Reads and writes are performed asynchronously, at a read/write speed of 327.7kw/s
and a Track-to-Track seek time of around 3ms. The average seek time is 80ms with a 
maximum of 200ms (200 cycles).  

Interrupt Commands
----

 - **0x0000**: POLL_DEVICE
	- Sets B to the current state (see below) and C to the latest error since the 
		last device poll
 - **0x0001**: SET_INTERRUPT
	- Enables interrupts and sets the message to X if X is anything other than 0,
		disables interrupts if X is 0.  When interrupts are enabled the m525hd will
		trigger an interrupt on the DCPU-16 whenever the state or error message 
		changes
 - **0x0002**: READ_SECTOR
	- Reads sector X to DCPU ram starting at Y. Sets B to 1 if reading is possible
		and has been started, anything else if reading fails.  Reading is only possible
		if the state is STATE_READY or STATE_READY_WP.  Protects against partial reads.
 - **0x0003**: WRITE_SECTOR
	- Writes sector X from DCPU ram starting at Y.  Sets B to 1 if writing is possible
		and has been started, anything else if writing fails.  Writing is only possible
		if the state is STATE_READY.  Protects against partial writes.
 - **0x0004**: SPIN_DOWN
	- Parks the heads and spins down the drive to conserve power. 
 - **0x0005**: SPIN_UP
	- Spins up the drive to make ready for reading/writing.  The drive will need a 15 
		second interval to reach the proper speed. 

State Codes
----
|   Value   |     Code       |  Description
| --------: | -------------- | ------------------
| 0x0000    | STATE_INIT     | The drive is still spinning up.
| 0x0001    | STATE_READY    | The drive is ready to accept commands.
| 0x0002    | STATE_READY_WP | The drive is ready but read only.
| 0x0003    | STATE_BUSY     | The drive is busy either reading, writing or seeking.
| 0x0004	| STATE_PARKED   | The drive has been spun down and needs to be restarted.
Error Codes
----
|   Value   |     Code          |  Description
| --------: | ----------------  | ------------------
| 0x0000    | ERROR_NONE        | There has been no error since the last poll.
| 0x0001    | ERROR_BUSY        | The drive is busy performing an action.
| 0x0002    | ERROR_BAD_ADDRESS | Attempted to read from an sector this drive doesn't contain
| 0x0003    | ERROR_PROTECTED   | Tried to write to read only drive.
| 0x0004    | ERROR_PARKED      | Attempted to read/write from a spun down drive.
| 0x0005    | ERROR_BAD_SECTOR  | The requested sector is broken, the data on it is lost.
| 0xFFFF	| ERROR_BROKEN	    | Theres been some major software or hardware problem.

Behaviours
----
 When first powered on (or after being spun down) the m525hd requires a 15 second interval in which to spin up.
 Attempting to access the drive during this time should return a state code of STATE_INIT and an Error Code of 
 ERROR_BUSY.  At the end of these 15 seconds the drive should report STATE_READY.

 Maximum seek time is observed when seeking from track 0,1,2,3 (rest) to track 252,253,254,255 (center of drive).
 Minimum seek time is observed when seeking between adjacent tracks.
