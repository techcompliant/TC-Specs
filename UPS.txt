DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: Universal Positioning System (navigator)
    ID: 0xfce26509
    Version: 0xb01e
    Manufacturer: 0x982d3e46 (TALON NAVIGATION SYSTEMS)

Description:
    UPS can determine it's position using a combination of signals from x-ray 
    pulsars and local navigation transmitters. PPS can function in all locations 
    of the Milky Way, but its accuracy will degrade in absence of local
    positioning signals.

    Talon UPS hardware provides the fastest signal acquisition on market.
    It can cold start (no time, no position, no ephemeris) in <55 seconds
    and maintains a steady position update rate of whopping 1 Hz.

Interrupt behavior:
    When a HWI is received by the PPS, it reads the A register and does one
    of the following actions:
    
    1: GET_LOCAL_COORDINATES
       Stores the current position data to DCPU-16 registers X, Y and Z.
       Halts the DCPU-16 for 6 cycles.

       The data is encoded as
         X (UINT16) x-coordinate (unit 1m)
         Y (UINT16) y-coordinate (unit 1m)
         Z (UINT16) z-coordinate (unit 1m)

       Register C is set with the operation status:
          0x0000       : Success
          0x0001       : Success, but reduced accuracy
          0x8000       : No fix
          0xffff       : Equipment malfunction
