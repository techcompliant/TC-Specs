DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
    Name: Tracking Theodolite TT-Z80
    Version: 0x6673
    ID: 0x3846bc64
    Manufacturer: 0xb8badde8 (Otec)

Description:
    Otec's premium Tracking Theodolite model TT-Z80 can accurately track a specified 
    target with a modern interferometric techniques and light tracking motors. Advanced 
    signal processing ensures data accuracy and reliability.

    Otec's Tracking Theodolite can operate at 20km range and is capable of tracking a
    single target with high accuracy and refresh rate. Refresh rate is close to 5HZ
    and refresh can be used to trigger an interrupt.

    NOTE: Tracking can be detected with Otec's tracking sensor array - sold separately.

Interrupt behavior:

    When a HWI is received by the Theodolite, it reads the A register and does one of 
    the following actions:
    
    0: GET_STATUS
        Register B is set to hold tracking target's signal ID or 0 if no tracking in
        progress.

        Register C is set to TT-Z80 status
          0x0000 Idle
          0x0001 Tracking
          0x0002 Target lost
          0xffff Equipment malfunction

    1: SET_TARGET
        Register B contains the target's signal ID (available e.g. from radar data).
        TT-Z80 will acquire target lock in less than 2 seconds and start providing tracking 
        data.

        Signal ID 0 will stop tracking.

        Register C is set to status code for operation:
          0x0000 Tracking starting
          0x8000 Failure, unknown target
          0xffff Failure, equipment malfunction

    2: GET_TARGET_POSITION
          B: is set to contain a timestamp for the position data. Timestamp is 16 bit counter 
          that increments every data refresh cycle and resets to zero at every 2^16 seconds.

          X: Target X-coordinate relative to theodolite (m)
          Y: target Y-coordinate relative to theodolite (m)
          Z: target Z-coordinate relative to theodolite (m)

          Register C is set to status code for operation:
            0x0000 Success
            0x8001 No target
            0xffff Equipment malfunction

          Halts DCPU for 3 cycles.

    3: GET_TARGET_VELOCITY
          B: is set to contain a timestamp for the velocity data. Timestamp is 16 bit counter 
          that increments every data refresh cycle and resets to zero at every 2^16 seconds.

          X: Target velocity along X-axis relative to theodolite (m/s)
          Y: Target velocity along Y-axis relative to theodolite (m/s)
          Z: Target velocity along Z-axis relative to theodolite (m/s)

          Register C is set to status code for operation:
            0x0000 Success
            0x8001 No target
            0xffff Equipment malfunction

          Halts DCPU for 3 cycles.

    4: CONFIGURE_INTERRUPTS
        Register B contains message for Interrupt on target data refreshed, 0 means disable interrupt.
